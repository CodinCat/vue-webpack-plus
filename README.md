# vue-webpack-plus boilerplate

This is a fork of official [Vue.js webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/), with [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) & [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) ready.

- Vue 2.2
- Vuex 2.2
- Vue Router 2.3
- Vuex Router Sync

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init CodinCat/vue-webpack-plus my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

If port 8080 is already in use on your machine you must change the port number in `/config/index.js`. Otherwise `npm run dev` will fail.

## What's Included

- `npm run dev`: first-in-class development experience.
  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint
